# Aggregate each heuristic across all algorithms
# Aggregate each heuristic modifier across a_star
# Aggregate each algorithm across all heuristics
# Aggregate each anchor heuristic for a_star_sequential a_star_integrated
#
# These can be done in excel by duplicating the sheet and sorting/aggregating:
# Fix w1, increase w2 as function of running time
# Fix w2, increase w1 as functino of running time
